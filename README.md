# DotFiles
These are the dotfiles for my ArcoLinux desktop using the Qtile window manager

Some of the features I've set are:
- Use of the [jonaburg picom fork](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom) to have nicer animations
- Custom keybindings to suit my workflow
- Changing the default shell to [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- Use of the [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/) to show custom information in your terminal
- Use of the [ricemood script](https://github.com/fhadiel/ricemood) to sync colour theme based on my desktop wallpaper
